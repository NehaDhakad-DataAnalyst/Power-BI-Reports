# Power-BI-Reports

ðŸ§  End-to-End Power BI Project â€“ Business Dashboard
This repository demonstrates a complete end-to-end business intelligence project using Power BI, SQL, and data transformation techniques. It showcases how raw data from multiple sources is cleaned, modeled, and visualized to deliver actionable business insights.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project involves the following stages:

1. Understanding Business Requirements-

   We begin by gathering and analyzing the business goals to determine what key metrics and KPIs need to be tracked.

2. Data Extraction from Multiple Sources -

   In real-world projects, data comes from multiple sources â€” which makes identifying and accessing the correct data a challenge. We simulate this by loading datasets from various formats (CSV, SQL Server, etc.).

3. Data Cleaning & Transformation -

   This is a critical step in any BI project. Clean data leads to accurate and meaningful analysis. We perform:

   Removal of duplicates and nulls

   Standardization of formats

   Data enrichment and validation

4. Data Modeling -

   We use Power BI's data model to build star/snowflake schema, create relationships, and prepare the data for efficient analysis.

5. Report Building with Power BI -

   Using over 30+ standard and custom visuals, we build rich, interactive dashboards.
   We also write DAX measures for additional business calculations.

6. Security & Deployment -

   Row-Level Security (RLS) is implemented to ensure users only see the data relevant to them.

   Reports are published to the Power BI Service, shared as Power BI Apps, and configured with scheduled refresh and alerts.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies Used
  Power BI Desktop & Power BI Service

  DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

  Power Query (M Language)

  SQL Server for data storage and querying

  Power BI Gateway for scheduled refresh
